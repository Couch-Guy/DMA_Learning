The FPGA project is in Vivado 2022.1
To build the Vivado project run the build script.
Some of the paths may need to be tweeked if Xilinx install locations differ.
I need to update the DMA_Simple.tcl script. Line 121 is set to my user should not be.

I am very green to using tcl scripts so they may need some modification.
